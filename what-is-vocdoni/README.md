# What is Vocdoni?

Vocdoni is a universally verifiable, censorship-resistant and anonymous governance system, designed to be scalable and easy to use on modest devices. The goal is to provide the foundation to run national elections, general shareholders meetings, assemblies, etc.

Our main aim is a trustless voting system, where people can speak their voice and everything can be audited. We are engineering the building blocks for a permissionless, private and censorship-resistant democracy.

The algorithms, systems and software that we build are intended to be a contribution toward making _violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users privacy with cryptography_. In particular, our aim is to provide the tools for the political will of network participants to translate outwardly into real political capital, without sacrificing privacy.
