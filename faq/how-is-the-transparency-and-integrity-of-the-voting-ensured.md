# How is the transparency and integrity of the voting ensured?

Unlike other electronic voting solutions, any person or entity can verify the integrity of the process and its outcome. We built a tool that specifically serves this purpose: [Vochain Explorer](https://explorer.vocdoni.net).

All our code is open and can be audited by the entire community.
