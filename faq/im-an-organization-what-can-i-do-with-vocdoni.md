# I'm an organization, what can I do with Vocdoni?

As an organization, you can: 

* Import your verified user base \(email\)
* Create verifiable and immutable communications. 
* Register new users through QR codes and manage their participation rights. 
* Create multiple censuses by segmenting by attributes. For example, an NGO may decide to hold a vote in which only women over the age of 18 living in Barcelona can participate. 
* Create participation processes of different types: public consultations, single-choice / multiple-choice voting.
