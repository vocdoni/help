## How much does Vocdoni cost?

We believe...  
At Vocdoni we have a mission: to democratize access to secure digital voting.   
  
It is for this reason that we have implemented a fair trade policy that will allow us to offer universal and free access to our platform, while offering payment plans with advanced features for those organizations with wider needs.   
  
End users never pay for the use of the platform. Vocdoni is currently in the restricted access phase. It is expected to move into the open access phase during the second half of 2020. If you are an organization and you are interested in using Vocdoni to make secure digital voting, you can contact us through this form.

## ve you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
