## How much does Vocdoni cost?

At Vocdoni we have a mission: to democratize access to secure digital voting.   
  
It is for this reason that we have implemented a fair trade policy that will allow us to offer universal and free access to our platform, while offering payment plans with advanced features for those organizations with wider needs.   
  
End-users will never pay for the use of the platform. Vocdoni is currently in the restricted access phase. It is expected to move into the open access phase during Q1 2021. If you are an organization, and you are interested in using Vocdoni to make secure digital voting, you can contact us through [**this form**](https://vocdoni.typeform.com/to/pygaYWCv).
