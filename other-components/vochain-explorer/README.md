# Vochain explorer

**Vochain explorer** is a tool to draw blockchain data and make it human-readable and searchable.

> Vochain is a _Proof-of-Authorithy_ blockchain network that uses [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) as its consensus algorithm. The main purpose of Vochain is to register polls, votes, and backing processes in a decentralized and verifiable way.

For most users, a blockchain explorer will allow you to search and explore data about recently mined blocks or recently carried out transactions on a blockchain. Ideally, they allow you to view a live feed of blocks as they are mined, as well as the data related to the blocks.  


You can use our Vochain explorer available here ðŸ‘‰ [explorer.vocdoni.net](https://explorer.vocdoni.net) or deploy your own instance in your server following the guide.
