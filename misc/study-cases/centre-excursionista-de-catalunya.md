### Challenge

Due to the restrictions in mobility and gatherings because of COVID-19, the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya decided to hold its AGM 2020 in a way that guarantees the voting rights of its 4500 members through remote participation and in accordance with the Catalan associations' law.  
  
They had certain requirements:

* Members should be able to vote from their homes using their own devices.
