# What kind of technologies does Vocdoni use?

Vocdoni platform integrates different distributed technologies: 

* **Ethereum**: public and immutable blockchain where the structure and components of voting processes are indexed through smart-contracts, including the public key tree. 
* **Vochain**: Allowed blockchain based on Tendermint that records votes transparently and immutably. 
* **IPFS**: distributed file system \([https://ipfs.io/](https://ipfs.io/)\) 
* **LibP2P**: distributed messaging protocol. 
* **zk-SNARKs**: to perform zero-knowledge tests that allow anonymous voting and the ability to change the direction of the vote before a vote ends, thus avoiding vote-buying and coercion.
