# Is Vocdoni anonymous?

Currently, Vocdoni has an in-built anonymity system through the use of information containers and identity obfuscation. A careful design of the frontend prevents third parties from knowing the meaning of the vote of each member and the possibility of crossing data.   
  
In Q12020, we will release a new version of our voting protocol that makes use of zk-SNARKs technology to get full anonymity into the infrastructure layer.
